A scary but interesting place where people come together and share their ideas and thoughts into a machine. This guy was overwhelmed by the amount of codes he has to learn from day one, but never gives up. He moved to the USA to find a better career path, and so He went to study in SFSU. When he finally graduated, he decided to seek for the America Dream. </p>
                <p>This guy is <strong>KAWAH</strong>. if you decide to take the risk and talk to him, you might go nuts! Please be advised, you can grab lunch with him anytime you want, but remember to pay.
